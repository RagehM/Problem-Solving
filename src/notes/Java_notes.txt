long = long * long
long = (long) int * int


Double area = 3.141592653 * r * r;
        String formated = String.format("%.9f", area);	


2.147×10^9
-2.147×10^9

Sum = n*(n+1)/2

(double) a / b: Casts a to double before division, ensuring the result is a double

if we want to split on + * / - we will need to add \\ before them

Math.pow returns a double

if we compare two values that may go greater than long we may consider taking log 


we can use ^ for xor operator that perform bitwise operation

2147483647 max pos value for 32 bits

byte b = 127;
int a = 12;

b = a cant store 32 bits in 8 bits 
so we need to explicit conversion (cast)
b = (byte) a

a = b will work fine;

float f = 5.6;
int x = (int) f;

to use method min() for long inputs we can use Long.min()

1 is not a prime number
